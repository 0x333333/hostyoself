**How do I start web hosting?** You will need to setup port forwarding, a dynamic DNS, name registration, MySQL, PHP, Apache and take a online course in Javascript. 

Just *kidding*! You don't need any of that crap. Just drag and drop a folder, or select a file. That's literally it. Now you can host a website from your laptop or your phone or your smartwatch or your toaster.

**How is this possible?** When the server you point at gets a request for a webpage, the server turns back and asks *you* for that content and will use what you provide for the original request.

**Seriously, how is this possible?** The relay uses websockets in your browser to process GET commands.

**Won't my website disappear when I close my browser?** Yep! There is a command-line tool that doesn't require a browser so it can run in the background if you need that. But yes, if your computer turns off then your site is down. Welcome to the joys of hosting a site on the internet.

**Won't I have to reload my browser if I change a file?** Yep! Welcome to the joys of Javascript.

**Whats the largest file I can host using this?** `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

**Should I use this to host a website?** Dear god yes.

**Does this use AI or blockchain?** Sure, why not. 

**What inspired this?** [websocketd](https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd) which shows the magic of websockets and [beaker browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/) which shows the magic of browser hosting.

**What's the point of this?** You can host a website! You can share a file! Anything you want, directly from your browser!
